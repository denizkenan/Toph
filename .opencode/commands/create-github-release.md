description: Draft GitHub release notes from commits since the last release
---

Draft a GitHub release for **Toph**. The version comes from the root `package.json` — the user passes no arguments. Follow the steps in order. Don't write release notes until prerequisites pass and the user has confirmed.

## Prerequisites — stop if any check fails

Read the `version` field from the root `package.json` and compute the tag as `v<version>` (always prefix with `v` — that's the convention). If any check below fails, surface the issue and stop. Don't try to fix things on the user's behalf.

- Root `package.json` exists and has a valid semver `version`.
- The computed tag doesn't already exist: `git tag --list "<tag>"` is empty and `gh release view "<tag>"` fails.
- Current branch is `main`: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` returns `main`.
- Working tree is clean: `git status --porcelain` is empty.
- Local `main` is up to date with `origin/main`: `git fetch origin main` then verify `git rev-parse HEAD` equals `git rev-parse origin/main`.

## Confirm with the user before drafting

Once prerequisites pass, ask the user to confirm — explicitly — before doing any more work:

> About to draft release `<tag>` from `main` at commit `<short-sha>` — `<commit subject>`. Continue?

Wait for an explicit yes. Don't proceed on silence.

## Collect commits

Find the previous release tag (`gh release view --json tagName -q .tagName`, fall back to `git describe --tags --abbrev=0`, fall back to the root commit if there are no tags). Then:

```sh
git log <previous-ref>..HEAD --no-merges --pretty=format:"%h%x09%an%x09%s"
```

For ambiguous subjects, read the diff with `git show <sha>` before describing them. Don't invent behavior that isn't in the diff.

## Group the work

Bucket commits using conventional-commit prefixes when present:

- **New** — `feat:`
- **Fixed** — `fix:`
- **Improved** — `refactor:`, `perf:`, user-facing `style:`
- **Under the hood** — everything else, collapsed (don't list each dependency bump)

Drop noise commits (`wip`, `fix typo`, review fixups) when the final state is already covered by a later commit.

## Draft in Toph tone

Load the `frontend-design` skill and use its "Voice & Copywriting (Toph tone)" section. Tone in one sentence: witty, nerdy, comedic-villain-but-friendly, developer humor, useful first, one punchline per surface, no emojis.

Skeleton (the title uses `<version>` without the `v` prefix):

```markdown
# Toph <version> — <short evocative title>

<One-line opener in Toph voice.>

## New
- <feature, one line each>

## Fixed
- <bug → behavior now, one line each>

## Improved
- <refactor / perf / polish>

## Under the hood
- <internals, single tight list>

## Contributors
Thanks to <@author1>, <@author2> for shipping this one.

**Full changelog:** https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/compare/<prev-tag>...<tag>
```

Use GitHub @-handles only when you can map them confidently (check `gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/<sha>` if unsure). Otherwise use the plain author name.

## Show the draft, invite feedback

Print the draft. Ask:

> Want me to tweak anything — tone, grouping, emphasis? Once you're happy, I'll push this as a **draft** release on GitHub.

Do not create the release yet.

## On approval, publish as a GitHub draft

Resolve the target SHA with `git rev-parse HEAD`. Write the notes to a temp file under `/var/folders/0n/rfz3pwlx6vdb_w2ftnq5ycqc0000gn/T/opencode/` (so Markdown survives), then:

```sh
gh release create "<tag>" \
  --draft \
  --title "<title from the draft>" \
  --notes-file <temp-file> \
  --target <resolved-sha>
```

`--target` must be the SHA, not a branch name — this pins the future tag to the exact commit the notes describe. The tag itself isn't created until the draft is published.

Report the URL back to the user.

## Guardrails

- Never publish a non-draft release. Never `git commit`, `git tag`, or `git push`.
- If `gh` isn't authenticated, surface it. Don't work around it.

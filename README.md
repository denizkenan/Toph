# Toph

A free, open-source voice-to-text dictation app. Think WisprFlow or Granola,
but yours to use, modify, and improve.

## Why the name Toph?

In _Avatar: The Last Airbender_, [Toph](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Toph_Beifong) is the blind earthbender who "sees" the
world through vibrations — every footstep, every heartbeat, every lie. She
doesn't need eyes; she just listens to the ground.

That felt like the right vibe for a dictation app. Toph hears what you say and
gives it shape, while staying invisibly out of the way until you need it.

(Also: short, memorable, not a stretched acronym. We're not sorry.)

## What Toph is built around

A few stubborn principles, in rough order of stubbornness:

1. **Bring your own subscription.** If you're already paying for ChatGPT (or
   whatever AI you've sworn loyalty to), Toph should just use that. No second
   meter running.
2. **Auto-edit like it cares.** Dictation that ships with `um`s, false starts,
   and "wait, actually..." trails is just transcription. Toph cleans up after
   you so the output reads like you meant to say it.
3. **No rant left behind.** Ramble for an hour straight and it should Just
   Work — no silent timeouts, no chunk limits, no "please speak in shorter
   bursts."
4. **Open source, in your hands.** Yours to read, fork, extend, embed. If you
   don't like how something works, the code is right there — go fix it.

## Getting started

Head over to the [latest release](https://github.com/YourTechBudStudio/Toph/releases/latest)
and grab the installer for your platform. Open it, install it, start talking.

## Updating your rules

Toph ships with three Polish presets — General, Engineer, and Email & Writing —
that get seeded into your local database the first time you open the app. After
that, **they're yours**. Rename them, rewrite them, scribble all over them in
Settings → Polish, and Toph will never silently overwrite your edits.

The flip side: when we improve a built-in preset (smarter heading detection,
better backtick rules, new structural commands), **your existing preset stays
exactly as it was**. We won't push the change down on top of your work.

If you want our latest cut, the source of truth lives in
[`apps/desktop/src/main/polish/rules/`](apps/desktop/src/main/polish/rules/).
Two ways to pull in an update:

- **Copy-paste.** Open the file (e.g., `engineer.txt`), grab the contents, and
  paste them into the preset body in Settings → Polish.
- **Nuke and re-seed.** Delete the preset in Settings → Polish and restart the
  app. Toph will re-create it from the latest source. Caveat: this also drops
  any customizations you made to it.

We're still iterating on these prompts. Worth checking back every so often.

## Want to get your hands dirty?

Building from source is two commands:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

That's it. The build step takes care of compiling native modules against
Electron automatically.

## Development notes

**Native modules** — The desktop app depends on `better-sqlite3`, which needs
to be compiled against Electron's Node.js runtime. This happens automatically
during `pnpm build`. If you change Electron, Node.js, or native dependency
versions and the app fails with a `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` mismatch, run:

```bash
pnpm --filter @toph/desktop run rebuild:native
```

**Database migrations** — After changing the schema in
`apps/desktop/src/main/db/schema.ts`, generate a migration with:

```bash
pnpm --filter @toph/desktop exec drizzle-kit generate
```

Don't edit files in `apps/desktop/drizzle` directly — those are generated.
